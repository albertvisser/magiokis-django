Magiokis (apps)
===============

This is the Django version of the webapps accompanying my original Magiokis website.
It contains rebuilds of the `songs`, `denk` and `vertel` apps.

It is mostly here as a showcase for how I built Django apps in... 2009?
However since then I updated them somewhat to keep them functioning.

Usage
-----

Run the wsgi scripts and configure the web server to point to them (see the examples).


Requirements
------------

- Python
- Django
